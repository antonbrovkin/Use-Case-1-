I need to create class named Country with single property named Population with type long.

I need to create a filter, which can use an array of Country items and filter it by Population property. Filter should show results which below entered value.


You can accomplish this in a variety of programming languages. Here's how you might do it in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public long Population { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<Country> countries = new List<Country>
        {
            new Country { Population = 50000000 },
            new Country { Population = 100000000 },
            new Country { Population = 200000000 },
            new Country { Population = 300000000 }
        };

        long threshold = 150000000;
        List<Country> filteredCountries = FilterCountriesByPopulation(countries, threshold);
        foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(country.Population);
        }
    }

    public static List<Country> FilterCountriesByPopulation(List<Country> countries, long threshold)
    {
        return countries.Where(c => c.Population < threshold).ToList();
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We define a `Country` class with a `Population` property of type `long`.
2. We then create a `FilterCountriesByPopulation` method which takes a list of `Country` objects and a `threshold` of type `long`. It returns a list of `Country` objects where the population is less than the threshold.
3. Inside the `Main` method, we create a list of `Country` objects and apply the `FilterCountriesByPopulation` method with a threshold of 150000000. The filtered results are then printed to the console.

You would compile and run this program, and it should print the populations of countries with a population less than 150,000,000.












I need to create class named Country with single property named Population with type long.

I need to create a filter, which can use an array of Country items and filter it by Population property. Filter should show results which below entered value.

for example if I put 10 value it should be used as 10 million




You can accomplish this by creating a `Country` class with a `Population` property of type long, and a method to filter an array of `Country` objects by population. Here is a sample implementation in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Country
{
    public long Population { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Country[] countries = {
            new Country { Population = 5000000 },
            new Country { Population = 10000000 },
            new Country { Population = 20000000 },
            new Country { Population = 30000000 }
        };

        long threshold = 10; // Input value in millions
        Country[] filteredCountries = FilterCountriesByPopulation(countries, threshold * 1000000); // Convert to actual value
        foreach (var country in filteredCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(country.Population);
        }
    }

    public static Country[] FilterCountriesByPopulation(Country[] countries, long threshold)
    {
        return countries.Where(c => c.Population < threshold).ToArray();
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We define a `Country` class with a `Population` property of type `long`.
2. We create a `FilterCountriesByPopulation` method which takes an array of `Country` objects and a `threshold` of type `long`. It returns an array of `Country` objects where the population is less than the threshold.
3. Inside the `Main` method, we create an array of `Country` objects and apply the `FilterCountriesByPopulation` method with a threshold of 10 million (we multiply the input value by 1,000,000 to convert it to the actual population number).
4. The filtered results are then printed to the console.

When you run this program, it will print the populations of countries with a population less than 10 million.
