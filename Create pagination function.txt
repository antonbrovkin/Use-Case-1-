I need to create class named Country with single property Name with type Name.
class Name should have single property named "Common" with type string.

Also I need to create a filter, which can use an array of Country items and show me restricted amount of results. I can put 10 in the filter this mean that filter should return 10 results

this should be created in .Net Core



To create the described classes and a filter function in .NET Core, you can use the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace CountryFilterApp
{
    public class Name
    {
        public string Common { get; set; }
    }

    public class Country
    {
        public Name Name { get; set; }
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Country> countries = new List<Country>
            {
                new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "USA" } },
                new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "Canada" } },
                // ... (add more countries to your list here)
            };

            var result = FilterCountries(countries, 10);

            foreach (var country in result)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(country.Name.Common);
            }
        }

        public static List<Country> FilterCountries(List<Country> countries, int amount)
        {
            return countries.Take(amount).ToList();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code:

1. We define a `Name` class with a `Common` property of type `string`.
2. We define a `Country` class with a `Name` property of type `Name`.
3. In the `Program` class, we initialize a list of `Country` objects and then use a `FilterCountries` function to filter the list and return only the specified number of countries (10 in this case).
4. We use the `Take` method from LINQ to get the specified number of items from the list.

Make sure to add more countries to your list to fully test the filter function.
