also I need an information how to run developer app written on .Net Core locally



Absolutely, here's a step-by-step guide on how to run a .NET Core application locally on your system:

### Pre-requisites:
1. **.NET Core SDK**: Ensure you have the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.
2. **Code Editor**: Have a code editor such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any preferred editor installed.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your .NET Core project is located.

### Step 2: Restore Dependencies
Before you run the application, make sure to restore all the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Step 3: Build the Application
Build your application to check for any compilation errors. Use the following command to build the application:

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
After building the application successfully, run the application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This command will start the application. If it's a web application, it usually provides a local URL (like `http://localhost:5000`) which you can navigate to in a web browser to use your application.

### Step 5: Accessing the Application
If it's a console application, you will see the output directly in the console. For web applications, as mentioned, open your web browser and access the application using the provided local URL.

### (Optional) Step 6: Use an IDE
If you are using an IDE like Visual Studio, you can open the project solution file (`.sln`) in the IDE, and use the built-in tools to run and debug the application locally. Usually, there is a "Run" or "Debug" button in the toolbar for this purpose.

Remember to consult the documentation or community forums if you encounter issues or need further assistance. It's a rich ecosystem with a lot of resources available!

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries(long? populationThreshold, int? amount, string commonNamePartial = "", string order = "")

need so examples how to use this .net core api



Certainly! This .NET Core API endpoint is a `HttpGet`, which means it can be accessed via a HTTP GET request. You can provide the parameters `populationThreshold`, `amount`, `commonNamePartial`, and `order` via query parameters in the URL.

Here are a few examples of how you might use this endpoint, assuming your API is hosted locally at `http://localhost:5000` and the route for this action is something like `api/countries`:

### Example 1: Get All Countries
You could start by simply getting a list of all countries without any filters:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries
```

### Example 2: Get Countries with a Population Threshold
To get a list of countries with a population greater than a certain threshold:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=50000000
```

### Example 3: Get a Limited Amount of Countries
To limit the results to a certain number of countries:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?amount=10
```

### Example 4: Get Countries with Partial Common Name Match
To get a list of countries that have a partial match on a common name:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?commonNamePartial=land
```

### Example 5: Get Countries Ordered by a Certain Field
To get a list of countries ordered by a specific field (e.g., population):

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?order=population
```

### Example 6: Combining Multiple Parameters
You can also combine multiple parameters to refine your query further:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=50000000&amount=10&commonNamePartial=land&order=population
```

### Usage in C# Code
If you want to call this API from a C# application, you could use `HttpClient` to make a GET request to the API like so:

```csharp
using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
{
    string response = await client.GetStringAsync("http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=50000000&amount=10");
    Console.WriteLine(response);
}
```

Remember to adjust the URL and endpoint route (`api/countries` in these examples) as per your actual API configuration.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions.

        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries(long? populationThreshold, int? amount, string commonNamePartial = "", string order = "")

need 11 examples how to use this .net core api




Absolutely, I can provide more examples showcasing different combinations of parameters to demonstrate the flexibility of your API endpoint. Here are 11 examples, assuming the API is hosted at `http://localhost:5000` and the route is `api/countries`:

### Example 1: Fetching All Countries
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries
```

### Example 2: Fetching Countries with Population Greater than 1 Million
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=1000000
```

### Example 3: Fetching the Top 5 Countries by a Certain Criteria (e.g., population)
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?amount=5&order=population
```

### Example 4: Fetching Countries with Common Name Partially Matching "stan"
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?commonNamePartial=stan
```

### Example 5: Fetching 10 Countries with Population Greater than 10 Million, Ordered by Population
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=10000000&amount=10&order=population
```

### Example 6: Fetching 15 Countries with Common Name Partially Matching "land", Ordered by Name
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?commonNamePartial=land&amount=15&order=name
```

### Example 7: Fetching the Top 3 Countries with Population Greater than 50 Million, Ordered by Population
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=50000000&amount=3&order=population
```

### Example 8: Fetching Countries with Common Name Partially Matching "repub", Limited to 5 Results
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?commonNamePartial=repub&amount=5
```

### Example 9: Fetching 10 Countries with Population Less than 5 Million, Ordered by Population in Descending Order
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=5000000&amount=10&order=population_desc
```

### Example 10: Fetching the Top 20 Countries with Common Name Partially Matching "island", Ordered by Name
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?commonNamePartial=island&amount=20&order=name
```

### Example 11: Fetching 7 Countries with Population Greater than 100 Million, Ordered by Name in Descending Order
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/countries?populationThreshold=100000000&amount=7&order=name_desc
```

Each of these examples demonstrates how various combinations of query parameters can be used to get different subsets of data from your API. You can use these URLs directly in a web browser or with tools like Postman or Curl to test your API. If you're calling the API from within a C# application, you can utilize the `HttpClient` class to make these GET requests, similar to the example in the previous message.

I hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you would like to know.
