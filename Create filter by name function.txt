I need to create a C3 class named "Name" and single property named "Common" with type string





In order to create a class named `Name` with a property named `Common` of type `string` in C# (I'm assuming you meant C# instead of C3, as C3 is not a known programming language at the time of my last update in September 2021), you can follow the code template below:

```csharp
using System;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    public class Name
    {
        public string Common { get; set; }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Name nameInstance = new Name();
            nameInstance.Common = "Some common name";
            Console.WriteLine(nameInstance.Common);
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:
1. The `Name` class is defined with a property named `Common` of type `string`.
2. Inside the `Program` class, an instance of the `Name` class is created, the `Common` property is set to a string, and then the value is printed to the console.

Remember to replace `YourNamespace` with the actual namespace you are using. If you're working within a single file without an explicitly defined namespace, you can omit the namespace declaration altogether.










I need to create class named Country with single property Name



Sure, to create a class named `Country` with a single property named `Name`, you can follow the template below:

```csharp
public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

You can use this class in your program as follows:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Country countryInstance = new Country();
        countryInstance.Name = "USA";
        Console.WriteLine(countryInstance.Name);
    }
}
```

In this usage example, an instance of the `Country` class is created, the `Name` property is set to "USA", and then its value is printed to the console. You can embed both class definitions and the `Main` method in a single file or distribute them across multiple files, depending on your project structure.

















I need to create class named Country with single property Name with type Name.
class Name should have single property named "Common" with type string


Absolutely, here's how you can create a `Country` class with a property of type `Name`, and a `Name` class with a property named `Common` of type string:

```csharp
public class Name
{
    public string Common { get; set; }
}

public class Country
{
    public Name Name { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Name nameInstance = new Name();
        nameInstance.Common = "Common Name";

        Country countryInstance = new Country();
        countryInstance.Name = nameInstance;

        Console.WriteLine(countryInstance.Name.Common);
    }
}
```

In this code:

1. We define the `Name` class with a property called `Common` of type `string`.
2. We define the `Country` class with a property called `Name` of type `Name` (which is the class we defined earlier).
3. In the `Main` method, we create an instance of the `Name` class, set the `Common` property to "Common Name".
4. We then create an instance of the `Country` class and set its `Name` property to the `Name` instance we created earlier.
5. Finally, we print the `Common` property of the `Name` property of the `Country` instance to the console.

This will output:
```
Common Name
```









I need to create class named Country with single property Name with type Name.
class Name should have single property named "Common" with type string.

Also I need to create a filter, which can get an array of Country items and filter it by Common property


To achieve this, you can create a filter method which accepts an array of `Country` objects and a string to filter the `Common` property by. Here is an example where a method named `FilterCountriesByCommonName` is created to perform this filtering:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Name
{
    public string Common { get; set; }
}

public class Country
{
    public Name Name { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Country[] countries = {
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "USA" } },
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "Canada" } },
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "Mexico" } }
        };

        var result = FilterCountriesByCommonName(countries, "Canada");
        foreach (var country in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(country.Name.Common);
        }
    }

    public static IEnumerable<Country> FilterCountriesByCommonName(Country[] countries, string commonName)
    {
        return countries.Where(c => c.Name.Common == commonName);
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:
1. We define the `Name` and `Country` classes as per your description.
2. We then define a static method `FilterCountriesByCommonName` which takes an array of `Country` objects and a string to filter by. It uses LINQ's `Where` method to filter the array based on the `Common` property of the `Name` property of each `Country` object.
3. In the `Main` method, we create an array of `Country` objects and then use the `FilterCountriesByCommonName` method to filter this array by the `Common` property. We then print the `Common` property of the `Name` property of each resulting `Country` object to the console.

This program will output:
```
Canada
```











I need to create class named Country with single property Name with type Name.
class Name should have single property named "Common" with type string.

Also I need to create a filter, which can use an array of Country items and filter it by Common property. Filter could use full or partial country common name and filter should not be case sensitive 


Certainly! In order to create a case-insensitive filter that allows partial matching, you can modify the `FilterCountriesByCommonName` method to use the `IndexOf` method with `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` as an argument, and check if the return value is not -1 (indicating that the string is found in the `Common` property). Here is the updated code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Name
{
    public string Common { get; set; }
}

public class Country
{
    public Name Name { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Country[] countries = {
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "United States of America" } },
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "Canada" } },
            new Country { Name = new Name { Common = "United Kingdom" } }
        };

        var result = FilterCountriesByCommonName(countries, "united");
        foreach (var country in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(country.Name.Common);
        }
    }

    public static IEnumerable<Country> FilterCountriesByCommonName(Country[] countries, string commonNamePartial)
    {
        return countries.Where(c => c.Name.Common.IndexOf(commonNamePartial, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) != -1);
    }
}
```

In this code:
1. We have the `Name` and `Country` classes as before.
2. The `FilterCountriesByCommonName` method has been modified to perform case-insensitive partial matching using the `IndexOf` method with `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` to ignore case.
3. In the `Main` method, we create an array of `Country` objects and then filter this array using the `FilterCountriesByCommonName` method, passing "united" as the partial string to filter by. We then print the `Common` property of the `Name` property of each resulting `Country` object to the console.

This will output:
```
United States of America
United Kingdom
```










how to set property to non required in .Net Core API



In a .NET Core API, you can indicate that a property is not required using a combination of nullable types and Data Annotations. Here's how to do this:

1. If you are using a non-nullable type (like `int`, `DateTime`, etc.), you can make it nullable by adding a `?` after the type name.
2. You can also use the `[Required]` data annotation to explicitly mark other properties as required, making the ones without this annotation non-required by implication.
   
Here's an example:

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

public class Country
{
    public Name Name { get; set; }
}

public class Name
{
    [Required]
    public string Common { get; set; }
    public string Official { get; set; }  // This property is non-required because it lacks the [Required] attribute
}
```

In this example, the `Official` property is non-required because it lacks the `[Required]` attribute. The `Common` property, on the other hand, is required because it has the `[Required]` attribute.

If you are using a model binding in a controller action, ASP.NET Core will automatically validate the model based on these annotations, and you can check `ModelState.IsValid` property to see if the validation passed:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class CountriesController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create(Country country)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
        }

        // Your code to handle the valid model here

        return Ok();
    }
}
```

In the above controller action, if a POST request is made without providing a value for the `Common` property, `ModelState.IsValid` will be `false`, and a 400 Bad Request response will be returned. If `Official` is not provided, the request will still be valid because it's not marked with `[Required]`.












how to set api parameter in .Net Core API to non required 



In a .NET Core API, parameters of an action method in a controller are optional by default if they are nullable types or have a default value. Here are a few ways you can make parameters non-required:

### Nullable Types

You can make parameters of nullable types, which allows them to be omitted. For example, a nullable `int` can be defined as `int?`, and a nullable `DateTime` can be defined as `DateTime?`. This makes them non-required.

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get(int? id, DateTime? date)
{
    // ... Your code here
    return Ok();
}
```

In this example, both `id` and `date` are non-required, and can be omitted when making a request.

### Default Values

You can assign default values to parameters, making them optional:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get(int id = 0, string name = "")
{
    // ... Your code here
    return Ok();
}
```

In this example, both `id` and `name` have default values, making them non-required. If they are not provided in the request, they will take the values `0` and `""` (empty string), respectively.

### FromQuery Attribute with Default Values

If you want to specify that the parameters should be taken from the query string and be optional, you can use the `[FromQuery]` attribute with default values:

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get([FromQuery] int id = 0, [FromQuery] string name = "")
{
    // ... Your code here
    return Ok();
}
```

In this code, `id` and `name` are taken from the query string and are optional due to the default values provided.

You can use these methods to make parameters non-required in a .NET Core API.
